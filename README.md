The word guess game or "hangman" game I made has the theme of Mr. Robot. Mr. Robot is a USA today show about a vigilante hacker. As for the actual application I made, I decided to stylize the site with the corresponding pictures. The javascript handles the game in the background with varying functions, loops, and other operations. The game has only a few cycling words, but it gets the job done, it allows people to guess a limited amount of times and it tells the user if theyâ€™re right or wrong.
